# Craig Gillham

Advisor, avp Group

My continued role within AVP is to offer advisory support as the business matures and continues to enhance its business model and execute against the over-arching strategy.

I started my career by joining Andersen Consulting as a post-graduate in 1993, working as a technology consultant.  I’ve spent much of my career working across various industries, helping companies deliver sustainable results. Ranging from helping them to develop new business enhancing strategies to delivering company-wide transformations. More recently, I have held Executive Director positions at various London & Global financial institutions.  

In 2017 avp fully automated our Hertfordshire family home.  I was so impressed with the extensive range of solutions and experience, I decided to invest time working with the business to relaunch avp to its current offering: a full suite of the most advanced technology that transforms your everyday living and work spaces.  

I am passionate about home and business automation and love the convenience and sheer delight that can be achieved. As a family, we love outdoor pursuits and adventures and thanks to avp, it’s always such a pleasure to return home.
