# Dominic Myott

Director, AVP Group

I’ve been a specialist lighting designer for over 25 years and have had the pleasure of working on many varied projects during this time. What can be achieved with the right lighting scheme is nothing short of extraordinary. Since LED systems were developed, technology has moved at pace; lighting is now energy-efficient and requires zero-maintenance without compromising on aesthetic appeal. Lighting is a major part of any interior design project, a space can be completely transformed by a well-considered scheme which captures the desired mood and atmosphere.

My role is to meet with clients to discuss how they would like their space to look and feel, considering all aspects of ​their ​everyday life​. ​This is followed by a ​detailed lighting plan which best achieve​s​ the desired result. As a lighting designer I will ​recommend​ the ​finest fittings and guide ​the client ​through the process of choosing any decorative features.

I love the ​exceptional ​bespoke nature of our work, the scale of a project may vary but we apply the same ​level of care and attention to detail every time. I was Sales & Design Director for a successful UK based lighting company for over 10 years before setting up my own consultancy in 2002 with a focus on residential clients. Over the years, the business has evolved and ​as a result we have also attracted an impressive list of commercial clients​ such as consultancy firm McKinsey & Company and The Economist, installing lighting schemes​ at​ ​both head offices in Central London. ​Demand for our business is increasingly borderless.
 
From remodelling stunning homes on a small island off Antigua and installing AV in 672 apartments in Vienna​ ​to working ​with specialist interior designers and architects to design and supply specialist lighting for super yachts, ​we have the experience and expertise to deliver the perfect solution for your space.
