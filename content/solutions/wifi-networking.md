      It’s common for modern buildings to be constructed using steel frames,
      foil-backed insulation and underfloor heating, all of which hinder
      wireless coverage. We carefully design and position multi-access points
      throughout the property to provide seamless coverage between all zones. We
      also ensure that your smart technology is adequately supported by this
      wireless network to achieve maximum performance and reliability.
