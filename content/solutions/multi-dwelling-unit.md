    content: "Feeling safe and secure is essential when living in a multi-dwelling unit. Timed access to communal areas can be granted at certain times of the day for postal deliveries whilst video entry allows a clear view of who is at the front entrance from the safety of the apartment. CCTV cameras provide an external view of the car park, front entrance and any internal communal spaces and all viewed on a TV, tablet or smart phone from within the apartment."
