      Start your day seamlessly with a morning schedule to wake up your house:
      turn on the heating, open the blinds and set the lighting to the desired
      level.<br /><br />Home automation systems maximise the comfort and
      convenience of everyday life whilst constantly monitoring what’s happening
      around your home. A night-time schedule can be set to automatically turn
      off all the internal lights, activate external security lights, lock
      doors, close blinds, turn lawn sprinklers on and shut down any active home
      entertainment devices. Saving you precious time at the end of the day by
      putting you in control of every space in the house at the touch of a
      button or by using voice control. If you’re preparing a meal in the
      kitchen, use voice control to adjust the lighting, turn on the radio or
      set the temperature in the room. With increasingly busy lives, a home
      automation system enables you to set your environment to exactly how you
      want it, whether you’re at home or away whilst also helping to maximise
      your energy efficiency.

      Control blinds and curtains in multiple rooms simultaneously at the touch
      of a button as you leave the house for ease and simplicity. Home
      automation systems can be used to open and close blinds and curtains as
      desired or as part of a regular morning or evening schedule. You can also
      set a programme to adjust the blinds in selected rooms at different times
      of the day to protect furniture or wall art from the damaging effects of
      the sun. If you’re away from home for an extended period, set your blinds
      open and close at set times for added security.
