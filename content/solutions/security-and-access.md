    content: "An automated security system, fully integrated with your other home systems, provides a superior level of performance and protection. You can receive an alert the instant there is unauthorised access to your property, allowing you to react quickly. The automation system can also link directly to the scene of intrusion and provide you with an image from the nearest surveillance camera. For added security, we can install cameras that detect motion, track and follow moving objects. These clever systems can also be set to trigger a range of events such as activating lighting or sprinkler systems if someone accesses the property and crosses a predefined trip line.<br /><br />We offer a wide range of security solutions, from simple four camera systems to multiple, thermal imaging cameras with remote viewing options, all can record activity for a predetermined length of time."
