      An automated security system, fully integrated with your other home
      systems, provides a superior level of performance and protection. You can
      receive an alert the instant there is unauthorised access to your
      property, allowing you to react quickly. The automation system can also
      link directly to the scene of intrusion and provide you with an image from
      the nearest surveillance camera. For added security, we can install
      cameras that detect motion, track and follow moving objects. These clever
      systems can also be set to trigger a range of events such as activating
      lighting or sprinkler systems if someone accesses the property and crosses
      a predefined trip line.<br /><br />We offer a wide range of security
      solutions, from simple four camera systems to multiple, thermal imaging
      cameras with remote viewing options, all can record activity for a
      predetermined length of time.

      Have full visibility of who is at your entrance, wherever you are in the
      world. Sophisticated video entry systems display a clear view of who is at
      your gate from any touch panel in the house and your mobile phone or
      tablet, these systems can cover multiple entrances and can even be
      accessed remotely so that you can see and speak to who has arrived at your
      property from anywhere in the world. If you’re away from home, receive an
      alert when someone rings the doorbell or set timed entry to allow access
      to through the gate or apartment lobby at certain times of the day.

      Check in on pets when you’re out of the home or monitor what the kids are
      up to in the playroom when you’re busy in another space via discreetly
      placed internal cameras. When integrated with a home automation system,
      internal monitoring provides an additional level of security and peace of
      mind whether you’re at home or away.
