      We’ve successfully completed many heritage projects requiring large-scale
      power distribution where it’s vital to adhere to strict guidelines to
      protect these beautiful, listed buildings. We’re sympathetic to the period
      during which the building was constructed whilst also making it suitable
      for modern day living.
