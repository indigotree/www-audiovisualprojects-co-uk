      Dedicated home cinema rooms benefit from superb sound quality thanks to
      carefully placed speakers which are discreetly hidden behind an
      acoustically transparent screen and walls to achieve a true surround sound
      experience. Sound proofing the room ensures that when someone is watching
      a film, the sound can’t be heard anywhere else in the house.<br /><br
      />Whether you’re watching the latest blockbuster, streaming your favourite
      box-set or gaming, big screen technology will surpass your expectations.
      We only work with the very latest UHD projector technology which are
      capable of delivering super high resolution, the highest dynamic contrast
      on the market and images that are bursting with ultra-bright 3D colour.
