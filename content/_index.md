# Making life extraordinary

We invite you to explore the endless possibilities of bespoke technology and see how everyday life can be transformed into something extraordinary. 
Imagine a world where everything in your home or workspace is controlled seamlessly from one simple device.

AVP specialise in transforming technology into state-of-the-art, extraordinary experiences by designing and integrating lighting, audio, home entertainment, climate control and security into one easy-to-use control device.

We specialise in both residential and commercial installations. Our projects range from prime residences and well-known Head Offices in the UK to private villas in Provence and boutique hotels in Switzerland. Weâ€™ve transformed over 100 basement projects and installed state of the art AV solutions in a plethora of conference facilities and auditoriums for large corporations.
