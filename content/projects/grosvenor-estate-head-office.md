# Grosvenor Estate Head Office, Grosvenor Street, W1

70 Grosvenor Street is the head office of Grosvenor Estate, ​representing​ the business activities of the Grosvenor Family, headed by the Duke of Westminster.

AVP was asked to design a ​discreet​ lighting​ solution​ to upgrade the entrance to the head office and the lobby areas and crucially to improve poor light levels in the space. We proposed ​a bespoke and elegant lighting design​ based on plaster-in lighting which complemented​ the existing interior design. Working closely with the client, ​we modified a distinguishing decorative feature as a focal point and carefully selected subtle companion fittings. The impressive lighting scheme retained the aesthetically pleasing wow factor without compromising on the practicalities required for a working environment. ​ All light sources are LED, ​controlled ​by an architectural lighting control system to balance the light level throughout the day and night.
