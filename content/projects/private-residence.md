# Private Residence Berkshire

Avp were commissioned to fully automate this private Berkshire residence which was built to the highest standards of specification and finish. Working closely with the architects and client from planning stage, we were able to maximise the opportunity to deliver a fantastic, bespoke range of solutions for modern living. The house has top of the range security options which provide great coverage both inside and out. Remote monitoring allows the user to connect to any space in the house from anywhere in the world and a sophisticated video door entry system enables a clear view of who’s at the gate from any touch panel in the house. This customised security features integrate seamlessly with the home automation scheme.

The whole house is automated using Control 4; from climate control, security, blinds, lighting and AV. To satisfy our client’s request for high-end sound in the living area, we sourced a Mitchel Gyro record deck and award-winning, hand-made Waterfall Audio high fidelity speakers to deliver breath-taking acoustics. The kitchen TV is mounted on a motorised bracket allowing comfortable viewing from anywhere in the space. When not in use, the bracket sits neatly into a recessed section of the wall. Wi-fi was installed using multiple access points to make one mesh for the whole house to ensure seamless coverage between all zones. During the design stage, we worked with the architects to ensure that the satellite dish and aerials would be discreetly hidden within the roof structure during construction.

In the home cinema, speakers are hidden behind an acoustically transparent screen and walls to deliver superb sound quality and a true cinema experience.

The plant room is the nerve centre of the house, where the cabling is neatly stored, along with all of the media centres, lighting control and network switches.
