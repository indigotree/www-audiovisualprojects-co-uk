# Leander, Chelsea Harbour, London

At 78ft long, Leander is the largest barge made by Piper Boats. As part of the build, we were asked to design and install a range of the latest smart home solutions for this beautiful barge. We worked closely with the team at Piper Boats and travelled to their factory on several occasions to install these smart solutions at the correct stages of the build.

We installed a custom-built Control 4 automation system to integrate the TVs, audio, climate control and lighting, all of which can be controlled using a tablet or smartphone.

4G wi-fi was installed using multiple access points to achieve complete coverage along the full length of the barge and to ensure that all smart solutions work seamlessly.

High performance speakers were discreetly positioned throughout to achieve high quality, multi-room sound.

Flat panel TVs were installed in the saloon and bedroom, with the added effect of a 5.1 surround sound cinema solution in the main living area.

We positioned a motorised satellite dish on the roof which automatically tracks and maintains a clear signal when the barge is on the move.

For added security, CCTV cameras were installed to provide clear images of the exterior, which can be viewed on either TV screen inside the barge or via a smart phone or tablet, whilst on board or from anywhere in the world.

Whilst Leander is more spacious than most barges, storage space is still limited. We ensured that all cabling and media boxes were neatly stored away out of sight but still accessible for maintenance.
