# Alpine House

Alpine House in Bushey Heath is an exclusive development of 12 luxury apartments, built by the award-winning developer Giles Homes Ltd. avp was invited to design and install the security and networking solutions for this project. 

We installed a Video Entry System to allow timed access to communal areas at certain times of the day for postal deliveries whilst video entry allows a clear view of who is at the front entrance from the safety of the apartment. CCTV cameras provide an external view of the car park, front entrance and any internal communal spaces and all viewed on a TV, tablet or smart phone from within the apartment.

A central antenna system was also installed to provide each apartment with TV, FM, DAB, FreeSat, Sky & Sky Q.
