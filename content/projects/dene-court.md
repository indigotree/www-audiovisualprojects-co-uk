# Dene Court

This development of 6 luxury apartments is set within an award-winning landmark building, right in the centre of the picturesque Hertfordshire town of Harpenden.

We worked with the client from the very beginning of the development. Our team of experienced electricians designed an electrical plan to ensure these apartments were equipped to support the latest in smart home technology. The main living area of each apartment features a data point which is hard-wired using Cat-6 network cabling to support advancing technology such as enhanced WiFi and Ultra HD 4k video distribution; this provides the perfect platform to support the installation of a bespoke home automation system such as Control 4 and can be easily integrated with platforms such as Alexa, Amazon, Apple TV and Sonos.

A central antenna system has been installed to provide each apartment with FM and DAB radio, Freeview, FreeSat/Sky and the option to upgrade to Sky Q and Virgin Media.

In each apartment, wiring has been carefully positioned in the ceiling of the main living areas to support the installation of speakers to achieve high quality, multi-room audio. 

The lighting scheme has been designed using rimless, plaster-in downlights to achieve a beautiful, seamless appearance.

For enhanced safety and security, CCTV cameras have been installed to monitor the main entrances. Furthermore, a video entry system provides a clear view of who is at the front door and can be viewed via a tablet which has been positioned within each apartment or via an app on a smartphone from anywhere in the world. Security alarm systems have been installed in the two ground floor apartments for additional security.

All cabling is neatly tucked away in a small rack within a storage cupboard by the front door.
