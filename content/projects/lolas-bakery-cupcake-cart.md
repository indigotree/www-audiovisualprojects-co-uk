# Lola’s Bakery & Lola’s Cupcake Cart, West Hampstead & London Underground Stations

In July 2017, Lola’s Bakery and All Day Café opened in West Hampstead, North London. avp were invited to be involved with the project from planning stage with a brief to design a lighting scheme, audio solution and security system for this exciting new eatery. 

We installed a Rako lighting control system and audio solution which included ceiling speakers and amplification for streaming with inputs for any audio source to create the perfect ambience for customers to enjoy Lola’s signature homemade cupcakes. A state-of-the-art security system comprising multiple CCTV cameras was fitted to protect the premises during trading hours and when the café in closed.

The building dates back to the early 1900’s, with beautiful high ceilings and period features which are common to the area. Our plans were carefully designed to consider solutions that would be sympathetic to the style of building and any associated planning restrictions, whilst also delivering maximum performance.

As part of the project, avp were asked to design an audio solution for the iconic Lola’s cupcake carts which are positioned in London Underground Stations across the capital, including in the Northern ticket hall of King’s Cross St Pancras Underground Station. We installed a small pair of Boston Acoustics cube speakers, connected to a mini amplifier which can be easily connected to an iPhone, iPad or Android providing the perfect, easy-to-use audio solution for these busy carts.
