## Why is Future Automation so highly praised by dealers and customers?

One of the many reasons Future Automation are so favoured by their customers is because all their mechanisms are made in-house, in their UK and US workshops. Their products are designed and engineering in-house to maximise system reliability and meet the needs of installers. By operating a lean manufacturing philosophy, investing heavily in state-of-the-art machinery and employing only the best, Future Automation can continue to innovate and expand the ever-changing moving audio-visual market.

Future Automaton’s customer-first business philosophy provides its customers with a seamless and enjoyable experience when transforming their homes with the technology and expertise provided by the employees at Future Automation.

Having every part of every mechanism manufactured in-house, it allows for complete control over the quality of Future Automation products throughout every production stage. This ensures that Future Automation’s mechanisms maintain a consistent level of quality that is unrivalled in the industry, culminating in a quality and premium of solutions for installers. This results in dealers, installer, and customers receiving products that cannot be matched in quality, making them the first choice for installers, dealers and consumers.

## What makes Future Automation one of avp’s preferred partners?

Focused on putting the custom back into custom installations, Future Automation products are unrivalled in their diversity, and their innovative product range is manufactured to order to the highest possible standards. Combined with the company’s unparalleled service, Future automation deliver a solution for every project; whatever the size and however challenging, making them one of the preferred partners of avp group.

## What is an example of a Future Automation project?

Future Automation were delighted to be contacted by the owner of an 8,000 square-foot home, located in the East Hamptons. It was important to the client that the beautiful views that accompanied this house were not disturbed by the technology within the home.

Architectural in-ceiling speakers were implemented throughout the property to provide a seamless audio experience throughout the entire home. It therefore made sense to align the hidden audio experience with Future Automation mechanisms to provide the optimal viewing experience.

The EAD (Electronic Advance and Drop) was installed in the main living area of the home. The mechanism provided a smooth and quiet movement forward, allowing the mechanism to manoeuvre over the mantlepiece to a more desirable viewing height. Within the bedroom, a customised PSE90 (Motorised Articulating Bracket) was integrated into the space. The PSE90 rotates toward the homeowner as they lay in bed for the best viewing angle. The compact design ensures the mechanism can remain hidden when not in use.

## How can Future Automation products be integrated into a range of homes; from the classic four-bed family home to high end larger houses?

Future Automation began life as a custom AV installation company, before moving into manufacturing. This means that Future Automation have experience working on jobs ranging from 1-bedroom flats, all the way up to multimillion pound superyachts, and it is this experience that taught Future Automation that their dealers want the highest quality products no matter the size or budget of the job in question. Future Automation’s standard product range encompasses simple on wall flat brackets, all the way up to 98”+ in floor TV lifts, while their bespoke design and manufacture service mean that the imagination is the only limitation. All Future Automation customers are also offered the same fantastic level of prior and post-sale customer service, no matter the size of their order.

## How can Future Automation products be integrated with automated systems such as Control 4?

The entire range of Future Automation’s automated mechanisms are fitted with IR, Contact Closure and RS232 control options as standard, and can be equipped with RF control upon request. This enables easy and direct integration into homes with existing control systems such as Crestron or Control4, while also allowing easy control of our products in installations where no control system is present. All mechanisms are provided with a full list of contact closure commands and RS232 programming codes, meaning installers have all the information they need to operate the mechanisms out of the box. A number of Future Automation mechanisms also feature additional control options, such as the PD Range of projector drop mechanisms which have the option of allowing installers to wire a projector screen into the control board. This allows both the PD mechanism and projector screen to be operated simultaneously from one input. Small but thoughtful features like this help to make the installation and integration of Future Automation mechanisms quick and easy for dealers.
